<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I love to read, I've been read tons of books throughout my life and I love the feeling of getting really into reading something and forgetting about everything else. Some of my favorite books and authors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books by <em>Rick Riordan</em></li>
<li><em>Harry Potter series</em></li>
<li><em>hobbit/Lord of The Rings</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I love playing all kinds of games. Video games, board games, anything. My favorite genre of games are Roguelikes. A list of my favorite games is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Risk of Rain 2</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>I love animals, specifically my 2 dogs Scarlet & Willie. They're both girls and they're miniature schnauzers. They're both very loving girls and they stick by your side wherever you go. I love them so so much even though they are <strong>NOT</strong> very smart.</p>
